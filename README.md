# Animated Isometric Social Media Menu
## HTML & CSS Only - No JavaScript
### Social media icons pulled in via Fontawsome 6.1
Three different sizes of menu constructed to show what this would look like at different scales

CSS Variables used inline with <li> elements so that a single class can be used to set the 6 different z-index values (line 175) and the 6 different rgb() values (lines 117, 124, 131)
